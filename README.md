## About this project
------------------------

We put in practice the knowledge seen in class. This project is about an implemententation of a parking lot in unity 3D.


## Argumentation

We choose a parking lot because of the typical real scence that we can interact in real life, our thinking was about understanding how difficult could be implement a real life action.


## Topics from Class

To create this solution, we will implement:
- Scenes
- 3D Models
- Cameras
- Cartesian Plane
- Boxes
- Shadows
- Textures
- Lights

## Technologies / Stack

- Unity 3D

## Requirements

```Unity 3D Hub```

[Install Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

## Scopes

1) Using 3d models
2) Using lights, textures
3) A 3d parking lot with all the scene and movements

## Example

- A typical parking lot with trees and ligths
